_â€“ The New Hacker News_

The goal of this project is to design a new GUI for y-combinator's hacker news website.
The design is focused on keeping things close to the original hacker news, while improving on 
usability where possible. Color scheme should look the same, functionality should be roughly the same
(but improve on wording to make things understandable to the new user). Most importantly, the design should
keep it's original hacker feel (this doesn't mean it has to be hard to use though).

The project is just in it's infancy stages, so feel free to leave some issues on github with your feedback and suggestions.

If you like this design, and want to encourage I keep developing a working app out of it in my spare time then please feel free to donate some Bitcoin:
